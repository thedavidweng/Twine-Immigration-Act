"Please support our movement to abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act!" I shouted, my voice still youthful but filled with strength. Passersby stopped to take flyers, and some even gave us a thumbs-up.

I haven't seen my mother for many days. My impressions of her are few and far between. In my memory, she was always coughing or lying in bed, and it seemed like it was always my father taking care of me. After I turned one, I saw even less of her. During that time, my father ran the tailor shop while also making trips outside, always looking exhausted. I was often left in the care of Uncle Huang, our neighbor.

Until that day, in the dimly lit room, there was only the soft sound of rain tapping on the windows. On the mantelpiece, there was a white statue of Guanyin, a brass statue of Sun Wukong, an old weightlifting trophy, and a photo of my mother.
I think, if it weren't for that remaining photo, it would be difficult for me to remember what my mother looked like.

I don't have many memories of that day, perhaps because I wasn't old enough to remember things clearly. Among the few memories I do have, my father and sister hurriedly picked up the phone beside the sofa, and then my father collapsed on the sofa, while my sister stood silently by.

In 1945, the war ended, but the shadow of racial discrimination still loomed over Chinese Canadians. Despite the significant contributions and even sacrifices made by many Chinese Canadian youths during the war, their community remained excluded from mainstream society.

For 7-year-old Larry, this discrimination was incomprehensible. He simply wanted to play with other children and share his char siu bao, but he was ruthlessly rejected. This experience made him realize for the first time that he was "different" from others.
However, Larry's warm smile and kind nature did not diminish because of this. Instead, this experience made him cherish the support of his family and community even more and sowed the seeds for his future role as a community historian and writer.

Uncle Huang's words filled me with strength. He took my hand and led me onto the streets of Chinatown. Colorful banners hung on both sides of the street, proclaiming "Equal Rights" and "Abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act." I saw many uncles and aunties busily distributing flyers, their faces radiant with hope.

"Stephen, look," Uncle Huang pointed to the crowd on the street, "these are people just like us, fighting for equality. Would you like to join us?"

I nodded, feeling both excited and nervous. Uncle Huang handed me a stack of flyers and said, "Go on, little guy. Tell everyone that our voices matter."

By 1945, the war had ended. 

Uncle Huang had not yet returned, but the aroma of sweet pastries still wafted from the bakery in Chinatown. Every morning, I could smell the fragrant egg tarts and char siu bao freshly out of the oven, like strands of warm sunlight. I loved standing in front of the bakery's display window, watching the owner skillfully knead the dough into small round balls before placing them in the oven. Whenever the oven door opened, the steamy pastries released an enticing aroma, and I couldn't help but swallow.

The owner always smiled warmly; knowing my fondness for char siu bao, he would always save a freshly baked one just for me. 

"Stephen, eat it while it's hot, it won't taste as good when it cools!" he would often say to me. 

I would take the char siu bao, cautiously bite into it, and the sweet and savory flavors would melt in my mouth—the crispy outer layer and the delicious filling always made me involuntarily smile. Dad said my smile was the warmest thing in our home, like a little lamp, illuminating our lives.

One day, holding a freshly bought char siu bao, I stepped out of Chinatown. In the park at the corner, a few foreign kids were playing. Their laughter rang out like silver bells, echoing through the air and drawing me in. They chased each other and kicked a small soccer ball, their faces brimming with carefree joy. I stood nearby, clutching the char siu bao tightly in my hand, feeling both excited and nervous.
 
[[Hey... what are you playing?]]
[[I have some char siu bao, would you like some...?]]
[[Can I play with you...?]]


:: 1947 {"position":"2000,200","size":"100,100"}
1947.

That year, the air in Chinatown seemed to carry a different scent, one that Dad described as the smell of hope. Uncle Huang finally returned. 

He wore a faded military uniform adorned with several shining medals. His face bore more wrinkles, but his smile remained warm. He told me that the war was over, but their fight had not stopped. 

"Larry, do you know?" Uncle Huang crouched down and patted my shoulder, "We old soldiers are working on something big." 

"What big thing?" I asked curiously. 

"We are making sure everyone knows that Chinese Canadians are also a part of this country. We are fighting for equal rights, to abolish the unfair Chinese Exclusion Act."

I nodded, not fully understanding what the Chinese Exclusion Act was, but I knew it was something that made Dad incredibly tired and that despite all the sacrifices made by Uncle Huang and other Chinese veterans during the war, they were still treated as 'outsiders.'

[[What is the Chinese Exclusion Act?" I asked, furrowing my brow. ]]
[[Uncle Huang, will you be successful?" I asked, a bit worried.]]


:: But... isn't it good to stay here? {"position":"1000,975","size":"100,100"}
Uncle Huang smiled and patted my head. "A good life means not being looked down upon, not being bullied, and being able to live proudly on this land. This is our chance to actively demonstrate our commitment to this land, and perhaps from then on, they will no longer look down on us."

:: Can I play with you...? {"position":"1350,350","size":"100,100"}
I gathered my courage and asked, still clutching the char siu bao tightly in my hand.
One of the boys turned around, glanced at me, and before he could speak, his mother quickly approached. 

"Stay away from him!" she sternly told her child, then glared at me, "Don't play with Chinese people!"

:: Crawl towards your father, “Dada?” {"position":"1000,450","size":"100,100"}
Dad let out a deep sigh and hugged my sister and me together. 

"We'll get through this together," he said softly, his voice firm yet unable to hide the deep sadness.

I toddled over to my sister and reached out to grab the hem of her skirt. 

She bent down, picked me up, and whispered, "I'll take care of you from now on." 

Her voice was gentle and resolute, but tears twinkled at the corners of her eyes.

I sat at the entrance of the bakery, listening to the uncles and aunties passing by as they shared their experiences. Some spoke of sacrifices made during the war, others talked about their hopes for the future. I wrote down these stories one by one. Although my handwriting was crooked and twisted, I knew that these words would become a part of history.

:: Hey... what are you playing? {"position":"1500,350","size":"100,100"}
I held up the char siu bao, trying to bridge the gap with food. 

One of the boys glanced curiously, but his mother quickly came over and said coldly, "We don't take food from strangers, especially from you."

:: I returned to the bakery and sought out the owner for a chat. {"position":"1375,625","size":"100,100"}
"Dad, why won't they play with me?" I asked, my voice choking up. 

Dad gently patted my back, was silent for a moment, and then said, "Some people still don't understand us, Stephen. But you must remember, you are just as deserving of respect and love as any other child."

:: I turned and ran back home, pushing open the door of the tailor shop and throwing myself into Dad's arms. {"position":"1625,625","size":"100,100"}
As I walked in, the owner noticed my dejected demeanor and asked with a smile, "What's wrong, little guy? Didn't you like the char siu bao today?"
 
I shook my head and said softly, "They wouldn't play with me because I'm Chinese."

The owner sighed and patted my head. "Stephen, the world can sometimes be unfair, but remember, your smile and kindness are the most precious things. One day, they will understand."

:: Looking at Dad {"position":"1075,725","size":"100,100"}
I looked up at Dad, and he gently patted my shoulder. 

"Let's go say goodbye to your Uncle Huang; he's joining the army," Dad said as he carried me towards the figure in the crowd.

In September of that same year, Dad pulled me out of the tailor shop, and today Chinatown was bustling with people. 

The streets were crowded, and the air was filled with an indescribable tension and anticipation. Many Chinese men about the same age as my father were dressed in dark green clothes and boots, bidding farewell to the elderly, women, and children at home. Their faces bore complex emotions—determination, reluctance, and a hint of worry. 

Among the crowd, there was also a familiar figure.

"What does joining the army mean? Why do you have to leave here?" I asked, puzzled.

Uncle Huang pinched my cheek and said with a smile, "Joining the army means going to fight the bad guys. We go to protect the peace of the world so that little guys like you can have a good life."

[[But... isn't it good to stay here?]]
[[What is a good life...?]]
[[There are no bad guys attacking us, so why do you have to go fight?]]

Her voice was like a cold knife piercing my heart. The boy was pulled away by his mother, and the other children scattered, leaving me alone in the park, still holding the now cold char siu bao.

In 1939, with the outbreak of World War II, the world was plunged into turmoil. For the Chinese Canadians living in Vancouver's Chinatown, the war was not just a distant conflict but also an opportunity to change their destinies.

Many young Chinese Canadians saw enlisting as a way to demonstrate their commitment to Canada, which could potentially help eliminate the racism they had long faced. However, many others questioned why they should fight for a country that seemed not to need them. This conflicting sentiment spread throughout every corner of Chinatown.

Uncle Huang's decision was a reflection of these complex emotions. He hoped that by joining the military, he could gain more respect and equality for the Chinese community. His departure was not just a farewell to his family but also a gamble on the future.

In 1947, the efforts of Chinese Canadians finally bore fruit. The Chinese Exclusion Act was abolished, and Chinese individuals gained the right to citizenship for the first time. This historic moment marked an important step forward in the fight for equal rights for Chinese Canadians.

For 9-year-old Larry, this year was not only a turning point in history but also a crucial moment in his personal development. He witnessed the efforts of Uncle Huang and other veterans firsthand and participated actively in community activities. These experiences deepened his understanding of what justice and unity mean, and laid the foundation for his future role as a community historian and writer.

:: Standing still, I stared at the char siu bao in my hand. {"position":"1500,625","size":"100,100"}
Its originally sweet aroma now seems bitter. I couldn't understand why they didn't want to play with me. Was it because my clothes weren't fancy enough, or because my hair was black?

:: There are no bad guys attacking us, so why do you have to go fight? {"position":"875,975","size":"100,100"}
Uncle Huang fell silent for a moment, his gaze becoming distant. 

He looked towards the sign at the entrance of Chinatown and said softly, "Little guy, staying here is certainly good, but sometimes, we must leave for a greater purpose. When you grow up, you'll understand. Uncle has to strive for our peace and freedom so that we can have good lives."

Dad slowly turned around, tears streaming down his cheeks. 

"Mom has gone to a place without pain, Stephen," he said softly, his voice hoarse and tired. 

He bent down, picked me up, and held me tightly in his arms. His chest trembled slightly, and I could feel his heartbeat, heavy and slow.

:: Uncle Huang, will you be successful?" I asked, a bit worried. {"position":"2075,325","size":"100,100"}
Uncle Huang's eyes became resolute. "We will succeed, Stephen. Because we believe that justice will eventually prevail."

:: Walking towards the figure {"position":"925,725","size":"100,100"}
I slowly walked toward the familiar figure, and Uncle Huang, upon seeing me, immediately broke into a smile. 

"Stephen, you're here!" he exclaimed as he crouched down and scooped me up in his arms.

 "Uncle Huang is going to join the army far away! Little guy, remember to think of me!" His voice was still warm, but his gaze carried a seriousness I had never seen before.

:: What is a good life...? {"position":"1125,975","size":"100,100"}
Uncle Huang sighed and his gaze became resolute. 

"Little guy, the bad guys might not come to attack us directly, but they make the world unfair. We join the army to make the world fairer, so that children like you can grow up in a better place."

:: What is the Chinese Exclusion Act?" I asked, furrowing my brow.\  {"position":"1925,325","size":"100,100"}
Uncle Huang sighed and said softly, "It's an unfair law that prevents our families from being reunited and causes many people to look down on us. But now, we are going to change all that."
