"Please support our movement to abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act!" I shouted, my voice still youthful but filled with strength. Passersby stopped to take flyers, and some even gave us a thumbs-up.

I haven't seen my mother for many days. My impressions of her are few and far between. In my memory, she was always coughing or lying in bed, and it seemed like it was always my father taking care of me. After I turned one, I saw even less of her. During that time, my father ran the tailor shop while also making trips outside, always looking exhausted. I was often left in the care of Uncle Huang, our neighbor.

Until that day, in the dimly lit room, there was only the soft sound of rain tapping on the windows. On the mantelpiece, there was a white statue of Guanyin, a brass statue of Sun Wukong, an old weightlifting trophy, and a photo of my mother.
I think, if it weren't for that remaining photo, it would be difficult for me to remember what my mother looked like.

I don't have many memories of that day, perhaps because I wasn't old enough to remember things clearly. Among the few memories I do have, my father and sister hurriedly picked up the phone beside the sofa, and then my father collapsed on the sofa, while my sister stood silently by.

In 1945, the war ended, but the shadow of racial discrimination still loomed over Chinese Canadians. Despite the significant contributions and even sacrifices made by many Chinese Canadian youths during the war, their community remained excluded from mainstream society.

For 7-year-old Larry, this discrimination was incomprehensible. He simply wanted to play with other children and share his char siu bao, but he was ruthlessly rejected. This experience made him realize for the first time that he was "different" from others.
However, Larry's warm smile and kind nature did not diminish because of this. Instead, this experience made him cherish the support of his family and community even more and sowed the seeds for his future role as a community historian and writer.

//Larry Wong suffered from dementia in his later years, gradually losing his memories. Yet, until his final moments, his warm smile never faded.

We extend our deepest gratitude to Larry Wong and the Chinese Canadians of the last century for their dedication to their community. It was through their efforts that younger generations of Chinese immigrants finally gained equality, respect, rights, and freedom.

Uncle Huang's words filled me with strength. He took my hand and led me onto the streets of Chinatown. Colorful banners hung on both sides of the street, proclaiming "Equal Rights" and "Abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act." I saw many uncles and aunties busily distributing flyers, their faces radiant with hope.

"Stephen, look," Uncle Huang pointed to the crowd on the street, "these are people just like us, fighting for equality. Would you like to join us?"

I nodded, feeling both excited and nervous. Uncle Huang handed me a stack of flyers and said, "Go on, little guy. Tell everyone that our voices matter."

By 1945, the war had ended. 

Uncle Huang had not yet returned, but the aroma of sweet pastries still wafted from the bakery in Chinatown. Every morning, I could smell the fragrant egg tarts and char siu bao freshly out of the oven, like strands of warm sunlight. I loved standing in front of the bakery's display window, watching the owner skillfully knead the dough into small round balls before placing them in the oven. Whenever the oven door opened, the steamy pastries released an enticing aroma, and I couldn't help but swallow.

The owner always smiled warmly; knowing my fondness for char siu bao, he would always save a freshly baked one just for me. 

"Stephen, eat it while it's hot, it won't taste as good when it cools!" he would often say to me. 

I would take the char siu bao, cautiously bite into it, and the sweet and savory flavors would melt in my mouth—the crispy outer layer and the delicious filling always made me involuntarily smile. Dad said my smile was the warmest thing in our home, like a little lamp, illuminating our lives.

One day, holding a freshly bought char siu bao, I stepped out of Chinatown. In the park at the corner, a few foreign kids were playing. Their laughter rang out like silver bells, echoing through the air and drawing me in. They chased each other and kicked a small soccer ball, their faces brimming with carefree joy. I stood nearby, clutching the char siu bao tightly in my hand, feeling both excited and nervous.
 
[[Hey... what are you playing?]]
[[I have some char siu bao, would you like some...?]]
[[Can I play with you...?]]

1947.

That year, the air in Chinatown seemed to carry a different scent, one that Dad described as the smell of hope. Uncle Huang finally returned. 

He wore a faded military uniform adorned with several shining medals. His face bore more wrinkles, but his smile remained warm. He told me that the war was over, but their fight had not stopped. 

"Larry, do you know?" Uncle Huang crouched down and patted my shoulder, "We old soldiers are working on something big." 

"What big thing?" I asked curiously. 

"We are making sure everyone knows that Chinese Canadians are also a part of this country. We are fighting for equal rights, to abolish the unfair Chinese Exclusion Act."

I nodded, not fully understanding what the Chinese Exclusion Act was, but I knew it was something that made Dad incredibly tired and that despite all the sacrifices made by Uncle Huang and other Chinese veterans during the war, they were still treated as 'outsiders.'

[[What is the Chinese Exclusion Act?" I asked, furrowing my brow. ]]
[[Uncle Huang, will you be successful?" I asked, a bit worried.]]

''Final Chapter: Embers of Memory

I open //Dim Sum in Chinatown// again. The copy in my room has grown so worn that its cover has turned pale.

Each night, I read a few pages before bed, as if trying to etch those memories—fading with time—just a little deeper. Lately, the words on the pages have started to blur. Not because of my eyesight, but because the gears in my mind have begun to rust.

[[I take out the photo album by my bedside.]]

It’s 1947. Uncle Huang and I are standing on a street in Chinatown, holding signs that read Abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act.

The wind was strong that day, sending flyers scattering through the air. Uncle Huang’s military uniform buttons gleamed under the sunlight.

He crouched down and said to me, “Go—tell them our voices deserve to be heard!”
That was the first time I felt like I was more than just an illegal child.

I’m standing in front of Chen’s bakery, holding a steaming hot cha siu bao in my hands. It was 1945. I was seven years old—the same day a group of white children refused to let me play with them for the first time.
Chen handed me the bao and said, “Smile, Stephen. A smile can break prejudice better than a fist.”

When I was twenty-five, my father called me to the workbench, gesturing at the rolls of fabric stacked against the wall. “They may look ordinary,” he said, “but if the stitches are tight enough, they can withstand decades of wear.”

I knew what he really meant: to survive in this world, I had to be like those fabrics—soft when I could be, but strong enough to keep from being torn apart.

:: But... isn't it good to stay here? {"position":"1000,975","size":"100,100"}
Uncle Huang smiled and patted my head. "A good life means not being looked down upon, not being bullied, and being able to live proudly on this land. This is our chance to actively demonstrate our commitment to this land, and perhaps from then on, they will no longer look down on us."

:: Can I play with you...? {"position":"1350,350","size":"100,100"}
I gathered my courage and asked, still clutching the char siu bao tightly in my hand.
One of the boys turned around, glanced at me, and before he could speak, his mother quickly approached. 

"Stay away from him!" she sternly told her child, then glared at me, "Don't play with Chinese people!"

:: Crawl towards your father, “Dada?” {"position":"1000,450","size":"100,100"}
Dad let out a deep sigh and hugged my sister and me together. 

"We'll get through this together," he said softly, his voice firm yet unable to hide the deep sadness.

I toddled over to my sister and reached out to grab the hem of her skirt. 

She bent down, picked me up, and whispered, "I'll take care of you from now on." 

Her voice was gentle and resolute, but tears twinkled at the corners of her eyes.

I sat at the entrance of the bakery, listening to the uncles and aunties passing by as they shared their experiences. Some spoke of sacrifices made during the war, others talked about their hopes for the future. I wrote down these stories one by one. Although my handwriting was crooked and twisted, I knew that these words would become a part of history.

:: Hey... what are you playing? {"position":"1500,350","size":"100,100"}

Tonight, the moonlight is particularly beautiful. Outside the window, the maple tree rustles, its sound blending into the hum of a sewing machine from my father’s shop—if only in my mind.

I curl up in my rocking chair, letting the tide of memory wash over me—my mother’s bloodstained handkerchief, my father’s closed coffin at his funeral, Uncle Huang’s flyers plastered across the streets...

Irene just brought me my dinner. She found the will I wrote this afternoon, sitting on my desk.

//"Bury me to the right of my father. The tombstone must be in Chinese"//

I see the tears welling in her eyes, so I quickly tell her, “No fussing now. Sing me The Moon Represents My Heart, will you?”

Outside, the maple leaves begin to fall again.

I fumble for my reading glasses and, on the last page of my journal, I write:

"My life is a patchwork quilt—my mother’s early death a tear in the fabric, discrimination a stain, resistance the golden thread. Now it is old, frayed, but every stitch is firm. Tell the children—the story isn’t over yet."

The pen stops there.

In the distance, I hear the chatter of the Blenheim Hotel staff. The scent of cha siu bao drifts in through the door.

I take off my glasses and raise my teacup to the empty air.

//"Dad, mom, — for this life, I did well enough, right?"//

Moonlight spills quietly across the floor.

"Dad, why won't they play with me?" I asked, my voice choking up.

I flip through its pages—photos of my father, my sister, and a man in military uniform. 
I realize I no longer recognize him.

When Irene from the Blenheim Hotel comes by to tidy up my room, I ask her who he is. (She knows me well—such a gentle, kind girl.) She tells me, “That’s Uncle Huang. You always said he was the one who taught you to write your first Chinese character.”
I pause for a moment, then suddenly laugh.

Dementia—what an irony. I’ve spent my whole life recording other people’s stories, yet now I can’t even hold onto my own.

On the last page of the album, my CI45 card is still tucked away. It’s yellowed with age, the ink fading.

When my father held me in his arms and took me to register all those years ago, he probably never imagined that his son would treasure this scrap of paper like a keepsake.

How wonderful that children today no longer have to endure this.

Before my memories slip away entirely, I want to turn these pages a few more times—to hold onto as much as I can.

As I walked in, the owner noticed my dejected demeanor and asked with a smile, "What's wrong, little guy? Didn't you like the char siu bao today?"
 
I shook my head and said softly, "They wouldn't play with me because I'm Chinese."

The owner sighed and patted my head. "Stephen, the world can sometimes be unfair, but remember, your smile and kindness are the most precious things. One day, they will understand."

In September of that same year, Dad pulled me out of the tailor shop, and today Chinatown was bustling with people. 

The streets were crowded, and the air was filled with an indescribable tension and anticipation. Many Chinese men about the same age as my father were dressed in dark green clothes and boots, bidding farewell to the elderly, women, and children at home. Their faces bore complex emotions—determination, reluctance, and a hint of worry. 

Among the crowd, there was also a familiar figure.

In 1939, with the outbreak of World War II, the world was plunged into turmoil. For the Chinese Canadians living in Vancouver's Chinatown, the war was not just a distant conflict but also an opportunity to change their destinies.

Many young Chinese Canadians saw enlisting as a way to demonstrate their commitment to Canada, which could potentially help eliminate the racism they had long faced. However, many others questioned why they should fight for a country that seemed not to need them. This conflicting sentiment spread throughout every corner of Chinatown.

Uncle Huang's decision was a reflection of these complex emotions. He hoped that by joining the military, he could gain more respect and equality for the Chinese community. His departure was not just a farewell to his family but also a gamble on the future.

In 1947, the efforts of Chinese Canadians finally bore fruit. The Chinese Exclusion Act was abolished, and Chinese individuals gained the right to citizenship for the first time. This historic moment marked an important step forward in the fight for equal rights for Chinese Canadians.

For 9-year-old Larry, this year was not only a turning point in history but also a crucial moment in his personal development. He witnessed the efforts of Uncle Huang and other veterans firsthand and participated actively in community activities. These experiences deepened his understanding of what justice and unity mean, and laid the foundation for his future role as a community historian and writer.
